""We have environmental field trips in every grade K-8. In this amount of time, I only had time to gather one grade level’s field trips for the past few months and they are listed below:
Hilton Bialek Habitat (which is actually on our Middle School’s campus): https://mearthcarmel.org/ 
Carmel River Watershed (which we work closely with) https://www.carmelriverwatershed.org/
Santa Lucia Preserve https://www.santaluciapreserve.com/about-us/conservancy

Monterey Bay Aquarium https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/
This is just ONE example of ONE grade level and this example of environmental learning is typical of ALL of our schools and grades. ""
""We are also a NOAA Ocean Guardian District
Environmental Justice and Climate Literacy have always been a strong focus for our district and it is embedded within every grade level content. 
We have science teachers (separate from grade level teachers) for grades TK-12). We also have garden teachers in addition to our science and grade level teachers at each elementary school. Students at the elementary level have integrated content focused around the NGSS and social studies standards from their grade level teacher every day,  then dig deeper into and explore more from the science teacher twice a week, and then engage with the EP and C’s even more with their Garden Teacher at least every two weeks. Our focus is that our students will embrace our beautiful world and sustain and improve it every day. In the words our our environmental team: “Student engagement, ownership, and leadership is critical.  Younger students can be effective teachers, advocates, and role models for older students and adults regarding environmental citizenship and the basics of caring for the environment.  KID SOLUTIONS are empowering and are what work best to persuade adults long term. We need (young) ‘Eco-Geniuses’ and ‘Change-Makers’ to lead others.”""",2.5,2.5,0,1,1,1,1,"Earth Day
Safe Routes to School - We are the second-largest district in California in terms of our land covered but we only have 3 elementary schools, one middle school, one high school, and a small continuation high school. It would be demeaning to our community to hold “Walk, Bike, or Roll to School"" days as many of our students ride the bus for over an hour to get to school.  Two of our campuses’ are off of Highway 1 and another 3 schools are located off of the busy Carmel Valley Road, so this also would not be a a safe option for our students. We appreciate the initiative but realize this is not something we could have within our district, nor would we promote for the safety of our students.
